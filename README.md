# Email_Classification

The goal of this project is to classify e-mails in 8 categories (updates, personal, spam, travel...) One e-mail can belong to more than one class (multilabel classification). The content of each e-mail is not available but we have data about the domain name (gmail.com...), the date of sending, the number of characters in the object and in the text as well as other features. 

The dataset contains 300,000 rows.
